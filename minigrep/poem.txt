A short poem may be a stylistic choice or it may be that you 
have said what you intended to say in a more concise way. Either 
way, they differ stylistically from a long poem in that there 
tends to be more care in word choice. Since there are fewer 
words people tend to spend more time on choosing a word that 
fits the subject to perfection. Because of this meticulous 
attitude, writing a short poem is often more tedious than 
writing a long poem
